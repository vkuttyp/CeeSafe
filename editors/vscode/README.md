# CeeSafe for VS Code

Language support for [CeeSafe](https://github.com/vkuttyp/CeeSafe), the memory-safe systems programming language that
compiles to C: syntax highlighting for `.cee` files, and, through the `ceesafec lsp` language server,

- errors as you type, with their diagnostic codes;
- the type of an expression, a variable or a field, and a function's signature, on hover;
- go to definition (F12) for locals, parameters, functions, methods, fields and types;
- the outline of a file;
- formatting (Shift+Alt+F) in `ceesafec fmt`'s one canonical style.

A file that belongs to a package (a `ceesafe.toml`) is checked with the package and its locked dependencies.

## Requirements

The extension starts `ceesafec`, the CeeSafe compiler. Install it on macOS or Linux with

```sh
curl -fsSL https://vkuttyp.github.io/CeeSafe/install.sh | sh
```

or on Windows, in PowerShell, with `irm https://vkuttyp.github.io/CeeSafe/install.ps1 | iex`
([installation](https://vkuttyp.github.io/CeeSafe/guide/installation)).
