# ADR 0026 — M14 K5: inline atomics, and atomics in every profile

> **Inherited from Nova.** This is Nova's ADR 0026, which CeeSafe inherited at the fork (Nova `v0.6.0`; CeeSafe's
> Decision 0006). Its text is Nova's record and is not changed: read Nova and `novac` as the language and compiler
> CeeSafe forked from, `.nova` as `.cee`, and Nova's C names as CeeSafe's (`spec/c-backend.md`). Links to documents
> CeeSafe did not fork go to Nova's repository.

- Status: **Accepted** (project owner, 2026-10-29), both questions as recommended (§5). The wording is the agent's.
- Scope: OD-27 (M14 K5's first item). How the atomic types' operations reach the machine, and which profiles have
  them.

## 1. Context

- **Today** (ADR 0016, ADR 0021): `AtomicU64`, `AtomicU32`, `AtomicUSize`, `AtomicBool` and `Ordering` are in
  `lib/std`, a hosted-only library. Each operation calls a runtime function in `runtime/hosted/nova_rt_thread.c`
  (`nova_atomic_add_u64`, `nova_atomic_load_ord_u32`, …). The ordered ones take the ordering as an `int` and switch
  on it.
- **The cost of the call** (ADR 0021 §1, `benchmarks/atomics`, Ryzen box, x86-64): the ring with acquire/release takes
  0.289 s through the runtime calls and 0.158 s written in C with inline `__atomic_*`, a further 1.8×. Sequentially
  consistent inline C was no faster than the calls (2.761 s against 2.170 s), because the fence dominates.
- **The kernel has no Nova atomics.** `lib/std` is not in a freestanding build, and `lib/kernel` (ADR 0025) has none.
  Roadmap 2.0's SA track converts CosmoOS's C, which uses the GCC builtins directly: 1,233 `__atomic_*` calls in 98
  files (`__atomic_load_n` 593, `__atomic_store_n` 393, `__atomic_fetch_add` 141, …; counted 2026-10-29 in
  `kernel/` and `drivers/`). A converted subsystem needs atomics of its own.
- **No library calls.** CosmoOS builds AArch64 code with `-mno-outline-atomics`, and so does Nova's freestanding
  profile (`profiles.md` §4.3). With it, gcc and clang expand every 8-, 16-, 32- and 64-bit `__atomic_*` on
  both architectures inline, with no `libatomic` or `__aarch64_*` helper (inferred from CosmoOS's own use; checked
  per architecture by the implementation, below). MSVC has the `_Interlocked*` intrinsics, already used by the
  runtime.

## 2. Options

| | A. Keep the calls | B. Inline in the runtime header | C. Built-in operations in the emitter |
|---|---|---|---|
| How | as today | the `nova_atomic_*` functions become `static inline` in `rt.h`; the ordering switch folds away where the ordering is a constant | the emitter writes `__atomic_*` with the ordering constant at each call site |
| Compiler change | none | none: the runtime and its header only | a new intrinsic kind in NIR and the emitter |
| An ordering not known at compile time | works | works: the switch stays | needs a fallback call |
| `-O0` | a call | a call to the inline function, with its switch | inline |
| Gain at `-O2` | — | as C (expected; to be measured) | as C |

B gives what C gives at `-O2`, where the ordering at a call site is a constant (it is in every `…With` call written
with an enum constant, after inlining), with no change to the compiler.

## 3. Decision

1. **B: inline atomics in the runtime header.** `rt.h` defines the `nova_atomic_*` functions as `static inline`, with
   `__atomic_*` (gcc and clang) or `_Interlocked*` (MSVC), and `nova_rt_thread.c` loses them. Nothing else in the
   generated C changes.
2. **Atomics in every profile.** `AtomicU64`, `AtomicU32`, `AtomicUSize`, `AtomicBool` and `Ordering` move from
   `lib/std` to `lib/core`, so freestanding and kernel code has them, with the same API (type-system §38.3). Their
   `Send`/`Share` argument (`@threadSafe`) is unchanged. `Arc`, `Mutex` and `Thread` stay in `lib/std`: they need
   the platform's threads and allocator.
3. **The freestanding profile's rule is checked.** A test compiles a program using every atomic operation with the
   freestanding profile's flags for both CosmoOS architectures and requires no undefined symbol (as C4's checks do,
   `c4.py`).

## 4. Consequences

- `lib/core`'s names are reserved in every package: a freestanding package that declares its own `AtomicU64` stops
  compiling (none of CosmoOS's four ports does).
- The kernel's Nova code uses the same atomics as userland Nova code, compiled as CosmoOS's C compiles its own.
  `lib/kernel`'s future reference counts and flags use them.
- `benchmarks/atomics` is rerun on the Ryzen box after the change: the Nova acquire/release row against the C inline
  row, and the sequentially consistent rows, under clang and gcc. The result goes into §6 and `docs/benchmarks.md`.
  If the gap to C does not close, C (built-in operations) is reconsidered.
- **Not decided here:** atomics on pointers and on 8- and 16-bit integers (add as converted code needs them), and
  fences as a library function (`atomicFence(order)`), which CosmoOS's C uses 22 times.

## 5. Questions for the owner

1. Inline atomics through the runtime header (B)? (Recommended.)
2. Move the atomic types and `Ordering` to `lib/core`, so kernel code has them? (Recommended.)

## 6. Implementation and results (2026-10-29)

- `nova/rt.h` defines the `nova_atomic_*` functions as `static inline`: `__atomic_*` with constant orderings in a
  switch (gcc, clang), `_Interlocked*` intrinsics (MSVC). `nova_rt_thread.c` no longer has them, and a program that
  uses only atomics no longer links it. The interpreter is unchanged (`CLibrary.cs`).
- `lib/core/atomics.nova` has `AtomicU64`, `AtomicU32`, `AtomicUSize`, `AtomicBool`, `LoadOrdering`, `StoreOrdering`
  and `Ordering`, moved from `lib/std/sync.nova` unchanged (doc comments added where lib/core requires them).
  Type-system §38.3 and §38.5 say so.
- The atomics' `Result` types would have been emitted in every program, because a generic instance made by lib/core's
  own code counted as the program's. Now an instance made only by a library's code (lib/core, as lib/std and
  lib/kernel already were) is emitted only where the program uses it. The `emit-c` snapshots did not change.
- **Freestanding** (§3.3): `integrations/cosmoos/k3/atomics.nova` calls every operation of every type, with every
  ordering kind, from statics. `k3.py` compiles it with CosmoOS's module flags on both architectures, one file and
  split: the only undefined symbol is the kernel's `panic`, so no operation calls a helper. On AArch64 the object
  holds the expected instructions: `ldaxr`/`stlxr` for acquire-release and sequentially consistent read-modify-writes,
  `ldxr`/`stxr` for relaxed ones, `ldar` and `stlr` for loads and stores.
- **Results.** `benchmarks/atomics` on the Ryzen box (as ADR 0021 §6: pinned to CPUs 1 and 2, median of 9,
  interleaved; load average 0.7–2.7):

  | | clang 18 | gcc 12 |
  |---|---|---|
  | Nova, acquire/release, through calls (ADR 0021 §6) | 0.366 s | 0.442 s |
  | **Nova, acquire/release, inline** | **0.215 s** | **0.195 s** |
  | C, acquire/release through calls | 0.296 s | 0.297 s |
  | C, acquire/release inline | 0.160 s | 0.157 s |
  | Nova, sequentially consistent | 2.508 s | 2.584 s |
  | C, sequentially consistent inline | 2.816 s | 2.116 s |

  The ordered ring is 1.7× (clang) and 2.3× (gcc) faster than through calls, and within 1.34× and 1.24× of inline C.
  Nova's ring is now faster than C's through calls. Sequentially consistent rings are dominated by their fences, as
  before, and vary by tens of percent between runs. Option C (built-in operations) is not needed for this gap: what
  remains is the ring's own code (inferred: the indexing and its checks around the atomics), not the atomics.
