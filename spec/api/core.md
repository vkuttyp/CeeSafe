## struct PhysAddr

```ceesafe
public struct PhysAddr
```

A physical address.

### PhysAddr.of

```ceesafe
public fn of(bits: u64) -> PhysAddr
```

The address whose value is `bits`.

### PhysAddr.bits

```ceesafe
public fn bits(this) -> u64
```

The address's value.

### PhysAddr.offset

```ceesafe
public fn offset(this, n: u64) -> PhysAddr
```

The address `n` bytes further on; panics if that overflows a `u64`.

## struct VirtAddr

```ceesafe
public struct VirtAddr
```

A virtual address.

### VirtAddr.of

```ceesafe
public fn of(bits: u64) -> VirtAddr
```

The address whose value is `bits`.

### VirtAddr.bits

```ceesafe
public fn bits(this) -> u64
```

The address's value.

### VirtAddr.offset

```ceesafe
public fn offset(this, n: u64) -> VirtAddr
```

The address `n` bytes further on; panics if that overflows a `u64`.

## struct Layout

```ceesafe
public struct Layout
```

The size in bytes and the alignment (a power of two) of a block of memory.

## interface Allocator

```ceesafe
public interface Allocator {
    fn allocate(borrow this, layout: Layout) -> Result<*mut u8, AllocError>;
    unsafe fn deallocate(borrow this, p: *mut u8, layout: Layout);
}
```

An allocator a `Box<T, A>` can use: a struct without fields that implements this (type-system.md §30.2).

## enum LoadOrdering

```ceesafe
public enum LoadOrdering {
    Relaxed,
    Acquire,
    SequentiallyConsistent,
}
```

The ordering of an atomic load (ADR 0021): C11's memory_order_relaxed, _acquire and _seq_cst.

## enum StoreOrdering

```ceesafe
public enum StoreOrdering {
    Relaxed,
    Release,
    SequentiallyConsistent,
}
```

The ordering of an atomic store: C11's memory_order_relaxed, _release and _seq_cst.

## enum Ordering

```ceesafe
public enum Ordering {
    Relaxed,
    Acquire,
    Release,
    AcquireRelease,
    SequentiallyConsistent,
}
```

The ordering of an atomic read-modify-write (swap, compare-exchange, add, subtract): C11's memory_order_relaxed,
_acquire, _release, _acq_rel and _seq_cst. A compare-exchange that fails orders as a load: AcquireRelease as
Acquire, Release as Relaxed, the others as themselves.

## struct AtomicU64

## struct Volatile

```ceesafe
@noncopy
public struct Volatile<T: Copy>
```

A cell read and written only by volatile accesses: a hardware register, or memory shared with a device.
Not Copy: a copy would read the register with an ordinary access, once, instead of each time it is used.

### Volatile.read

```ceesafe
public fn read(borrow this) -> T
```

Safety: `this.value` is a live, aligned `T` (it is a field), and the read is a single volatile access.

### Volatile.write

```ceesafe
public fn write(borrow mut this, v: T)
```

Safety: as `read`; `borrow mut this` makes the write exclusive.

## struct MmioPtr

```ceesafe
@noncopy
public struct MmioPtr<T>
```

The address of a memory-mapped `T`, typically a `@repr(C)` struct of `Volatile` registers. Not Copy: two
copies would be two owners of the same registers.

### MmioPtr.at

```ceesafe
public unsafe fn at(address: usize) -> MmioPtr<T>
```

Safety: `address` is mapped, aligned for `T`, and no other `MmioPtr` or reference aliases the registers.

### MmioPtr.get

```ceesafe
public fn get(borrow this) -> borrow T
```

Safety: `at`'s contract makes `base` a live `T` reached only through this value; the result borrows `this`.

### MmioPtr.getMut

```ceesafe
public fn getMut(borrow mut this) -> borrow mut T
```

Safety: as `get`; `borrow mut this` makes the access exclusive.

### MmioPtr.address

```ceesafe
public fn address(borrow this) -> usize
```

The address of the registers, as given to `at`.

## struct SliceHalves

```ceesafe
public struct SliceHalves<region r, T> {
    public left: Slice<r, T>;
    public right: Slice<r, T>;
}
```

The two parts of a slice that `splitAt` divides (type-system.md §16.5): the elements before the split, and from it on.

## struct SliceHalvesMut

```ceesafe
public struct SliceHalvesMut<region r, T> {
    public left: SliceMut<r, T>;
    public right: SliceMut<r, T>;
}
```

The two parts of a mutable slice that `splitAtMut` divides: disjoint, so both may be written at once.

## struct SliceSplitting

```ceesafe
public struct SliceSplitting<region r, T>
```

Splitting a slice in two (type-system.md §16.5): `s.splitAt(mid)` is `SliceSplitting<T>.splitAt(s, mid)`. The
struct's region ties the halves to the slice they come from; it has no fields and is never made.

### SliceSplitting.splitAt

```ceesafe
public fn splitAt(s: Slice<r, T>, mid: usize) -> SliceHalves<r, T>
```

The elements before `mid`, and from `mid` on; panics if `mid` is past the end.

### SliceSplitting.splitAtMut

```ceesafe
public fn splitAtMut(s: SliceMut<r, T>, mid: usize) -> SliceHalvesMut<r, T>
```

As splitAt, for a mutable slice: two mutable slices that do not overlap.
Safety: slicing `s[mid..]` checks `mid` against the length (it panics past the end), so `[0, mid)` and
`[mid, length)` are inside `s` and disjoint, and each is lent for as long as `s` is.

## struct SliceAlgorithms

```ceesafe
public struct SliceAlgorithms<T>
```

The algorithms over a slice of `T`, as static functions: the struct has no fields and is never made.

### SliceAlgorithms.sortBy

```ceesafe
@effectsOf(cmp)
public fn sortBy(s: SliceMut<T>, cmp: borrow mut fn(borrow T, borrow T) -> i32)
```

Orders `s` so that `cmp` of each element and the next is at most zero, for a consistent `cmp`. Not stable.
An introsort: quicksort with a median-of-three pivot, insertion sort for short runs, and heapsort past a
depth of 2·log₂ n, so O(n log n) calls of `cmp` in the worst case. Allocates nothing; the recursion is on
the shorter side, so the stack is O(log n). An inconsistent `cmp` leaves some permutation of `s`.

### SliceAlgorithms.forEach

```ceesafe
@effectsOf(visit)
public fn forEach(s: Slice<T>, visit: borrow mut fn(borrow T))
```

Calls `visit` on each element, in index order.

### SliceAlgorithms.any

```ceesafe
@effectsOf(test)
public fn any(s: Slice<T>, test: borrow mut fn(borrow T) -> bool) -> bool
```

Does `test` return true for some element? Stops at the first that does.

### SliceAlgorithms.all

```ceesafe
@effectsOf(test)
public fn all(s: Slice<T>, test: borrow mut fn(borrow T) -> bool) -> bool
```

Does `test` return true for every element? Stops at the first that does not.

### SliceAlgorithms.retain

```ceesafe
@effectsOf(keep)
public fn retain(s: SliceMut<T>, keep: borrow mut fn(borrow T) -> bool) -> usize
```

Moves the elements for which `keep` returns true to the front, in order, calling it once on each element in
index order; returns how many there are. `v.retain(keep)` then truncates the vector to that length.
