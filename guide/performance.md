# Performance

CeeSafe compiles through C, with every safety check on: array bounds, integer overflow, lossy conversions. This page
measures what that costs against Rust and plain C on sixteen workloads, and says where CeeSafe is ahead or behind and
why.

## The result

Over the sixteen workloads CeeSafe takes **0.96× Rust's time** (geometric mean), and **0.88×** that of Rust built with
overflow checks, which is the comparison that checks the same things CeeSafe does. Hand-written C without any check takes
0.94×.

Times are each language's median wall time over five runs (after one discarded run) divided by Rust's; lower is
faster. Measured 2026-10-31 on an Apple M-series Mac (arm64, macOS), with ceesafec 0.2.0-dev, rustc 1.99.1 and Apple
clang 21. A run-to-run spread of a few percent is normal: compare ratios, not single milliseconds.

Peak memory is the same as Rust's or lower everywhere (`arena`: 7.8 MiB against 17.7 MiB). Binaries are about 40–56 KiB
against Rust's 460 KiB. ceesafec compiles each program in about a quarter of a second, roughly twice rustc's time on these
single-file programs, since it runs the C compiler after its own work.

## Where CeeSafe is ahead

- **`heap-alloc`, 3.5× faster than Rust.** ceesafec's placement optimisation keeps a box that never escapes its
  function on the stack, so the program's per-iteration heap array costs no allocation at all. It beats hand-written C,
  which calls `malloc` and `free` each time.
- **`stack-alloc`, `nbody`, `vector-growth`.** CeeSafe matches C. Its overflow and bounds checks are removed where
  ceesafec proves they cannot fail (loop indexes within a length, sums of bounded values), which Rust with overflow
  checks does not manage on `stack-alloc` (1.70×).
- **`arena`.** A region's bump allocation is inlined into the program (Decision 0007), and the arena's chunks take less
  than half the memory of Rust's.

## Where CeeSafe is behind, and why

- **`hash-map` (1.41×).** Rust builds its tables with `vec![0; n]`, so LLVM knows their length and removes the bounds
  checks on `keys[s & MASK]`. A CeeSafe `Vector` can only be filled by `push`, so the length is unknown and every probe
  keeps its check: with the checks compiled out the program runs at Rust's speed. A filled-vector constructor would
  close this gap.
- **`recursion` (1.26×) and `parsing` (1.16×).** The overflow check on `fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)` and on accumulating
  digits cannot be proven unnecessary; Rust pays the same when its overflow checks are on (1.26× and 1.10×).
- **`data-oriented` (1.18×).** As for `hash-map`, the particle arrays are filled by `push`; the bounds checks cost about
  11%.
- **`binary-trees` (1.13×) and `small-objects` (1.03×).** Every heap allocation goes through the runtime's
  `ceesafe_alloc`, which counts allocations (for `CEESAFE_ALLOC_REPORT` and fault injection) before calling `malloc`.
  Calling `malloc` directly measured 12% faster on both.

## Run it yourself

```sh
python3 benchmarks/run.py                                    # every workload: cee, rust, rust-checked, c; 5 runs
python3 benchmarks/run.py --workloads hash-map,nbody --runs 3
python3 benchmarks/run.py --cee-flag --no-bce                # with bounds-check elimination off
```

Each workload is the same algorithm with the same data structures in every language, and prints one checksum, which
the runner checks. `benchmarks/README.md` describes the workloads and the build flags. To see which checks ceesafec kept
in a program, build it with `--explain-bounds-checks`, `--explain-overflow-checks` or `--explain-allocations`
([The ceesafec command](ceesafec.md)).
