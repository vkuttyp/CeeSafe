# Structs, enums and patterns

## Structs

A struct groups named fields. Fields end with `;`. Functions declared inside are its methods (with a `this`
receiver) or static functions (without one).

```ceesafe
struct Point {
    x: i64;
    y: i64;

    fn origin() -> Point => Point { x: 0, y: 0 };            // static: Point.origin()

    fn manhattan(this) -> i64 {                               // `this` by value (Point is Copy)
        return abs(this.x) + abs(this.y);
    }

    fn moveBy(borrow mut this, dx: i64, dy: i64) {            // changes the point in place
        this.x += dx;
        this.y += dy;
    }
}

fn abs(v: i64) -> i64 => if (v < 0) -v else v;

fn main() {
    var p = Point.origin();
    p.moveBy(3, -4);
    Console.writeLine(p.manhattan());
    let q = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };       // every field, in any order
    Console.writeLine(q.x + q.y);
}
```

- A **struct literal** names every field exactly once.
- The **receiver** says how a method gets its struct: `this` (a copy, or a move), `borrow this` (read-only access) or
  `borrow mut this` (changes the caller's value). Calling a `borrow mut this` method needs a `var` (or a mutable
  reference); the call borrows it for the duration of the call.
- A struct is **Copy**, copied on assignment, when every field is Copy and it has no `drop` block. Otherwise it
  moves: see [Ownership](ownership.md).
- Fields are laid out in declaration order with C's rules, so a struct is the same in C.

### Visibility

Items and members are `internal` by default: visible throughout their package. `public` makes them visible to other
packages (see [Packages](packages.md)); `private` on a field limits it to the file that declares the struct, which
lets a type guard an invariant.

## Enums

An enum is one of several variants, each with zero or more positional payloads. Variants are written with the enum's
name.

```ceesafe
enum Shape {
    Empty,
    Circle(i64),
    Rect(i64, i64),
}

fn area(s: Shape) -> i64 => match (s) {
    Shape.Empty => 0,
    Shape.Circle(r) => 3 * r * r,
    Shape.Rect(w, h) => w * h,
};

fn main() {
    Console.writeLine(area(Shape.Circle(2)));
    Console.writeLine(area(Shape.Rect(3, 4)));
    Console.writeLine(area(Shape.Empty));
}
```

## `match`

`match` tries its arms in order. It must be **exhaustive**: every possible value matches some arm, or the compiler
names one that does not. An arm that can never be reached is an error too.

As a statement, each arm is a block; as an expression (above), each arm is a value, separated by commas.

```ceesafe
enum Command {
    Move(i32, i32),
    Wait(u32),
    Quit,
}

fn run(command: Command) {
    match (command) {
        Command.Move(0, 0) => { Console.writeLine("stay"); }
        Command.Move(x, _) => {
            Console.write("move x by ");
            Console.writeLine(x);
        }
        Command.Wait(seconds) => {
            Console.write("wait ");
            Console.writeLine(seconds);
        }
        Command.Quit => {}
    }
}

fn main() {
    run(Command.Move(0, 0));
    run(Command.Move(5, 1));
    run(Command.Wait(3));
    run(Command.Quit);
}
```

```text
stay
move x by 5
wait 3
```

Patterns can be nested: a variant inside a variant (`Ok(Shape.Circle(r))`), a literal in a payload's position
(`Command.Move(0, 0)`), `null` or `Some(…)` for optionals, and `_` for anything. Integers and booleans can be matched
directly, with `_` for the rest.

```ceesafe
fn kind(n: u8) -> StringView => match (n) {
    0 => "zero",
    'a' => "the letter a",
    _ => "something else",
};

fn main() {
    Console.writeLine(kind(97));
    Console.writeLine(kind(3));
}
```

```text
the letter a
something else
```

## Optionals

`T?` is a `T` or `null`. A plain `T` converts to `T?` wherever one is expected.

```ceesafe
fn find(values: Slice<i32>, wanted: i32) -> usize? {
    for (i in 0..values.length) {
        if (values[i] == wanted) {
            return i;                  // converts to usize?
        }
    }
    return null;
}

fn firstOfTwo(values: Slice<i32>) -> usize? {
    let a = find(values, 2)?;           // `?`: if null, return null
    return a;
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = [5, 2, 9];
    match (find(numbers[..], 9)) {
        Some(i) => { Console.writeLine(i); }
        null => { Console.writeLine("absent"); }
    }
    Console.writeLine(find(numbers[..], 7) == null);
    Console.writeLine(firstOfTwo(numbers[..])!);   // `!`: the value, or stop the program if null
}
```

```text
2
true
1
```

- `o == null` and `o != null` test for absence.
- `o!` is the value; on `null` it stops the program with "unwrapped null".
- `o?` is the value; on `null` the enclosing function returns `null` (it must return an optional).
- A reference can be optional (`borrow T?`), and so can a box (`Box<T>?`); both are one pointer.

## Results

`Result<T, E>` is the other built-in enum: `Ok(value)` or `Err(error)`. It is how functions report failure; see
[Errors](errors.md).
