# Arrays, slices and collections

## Arrays

`[T; N]` is `N` values of `T`, inline: on the stack, or inside the struct that holds it. Arrays are values (copied
when assigned) and their element type must be Copy.

```ceesafe
fn main() {
    var squares = [0u32; 5];               // five zeros
    for (i in 0..squares.length) {
        squares[i] = truncate<u32>(i * i);    // usize to u32 could lose bits: say so
    }
    let primes = [2, 3, 5, 7];
    var sum = 0;
    for (p in primes) {
        sum += p;
    }
    Console.writeLine(squares[4]);
    Console.writeLine(sum);
}
```

Every index is checked: `a[i]` with `i >= a.length` stops the program. The compiler removes the check where it can
prove the index is in range, as in both loops above.

## Slices

`Slice<T>` is a borrowed view of consecutive elements, and `SliceMut<T>` a borrowed view that can change them. They
are a pointer and a length, they follow every rule for references, and they are how functions take "some elements":

```ceesafe
fn total(values: Slice<i64>) -> i64 {
    var sum: i64 = 0;
    for (v in values) {
        sum += v;
    }
    return sum;
}

fn double(values: SliceMut<i64>) {
    for (i in 0..values.length) {
        values[i] *= 2;
    }
}

fn main() {
    var numbers = [1i64, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    double(mut numbers[1..3]);              // elements 1 and 2
    Console.writeLine(total(numbers[..]));
    Console.writeLine(total(numbers[3..]));
}
```

```text

```

`a[lo..hi]`, `a[lo..]`, `a[..hi]` and `a[..]` take elements `lo` up to `hi`; the range is checked. A slice borrows
the whole array it came from, so the array cannot change while the slice is used.

Slices also copy and fill in one checked operation (`d.copyFrom(s)`, `d.fill(v)`), swap elements, and sort and
search with closures (see [Functions and closures](closures.md)).

## Vectors

`Vector<T>` owns a growable list on the heap. Pushing can fail, so `push` returns a `Result`.

```ceesafe
fn main() {
    var v = Vector<i32>.create();          // allocates nothing yet
    for (i in 0..5) {
        v.push(i * 10)!;
    }
    Console.writeLine(v.length);
    Console.writeLine(v[2]);
    match (v.pop()) {                      // i32?: null when empty
        Some(last) => { Console.writeLine(last); }
        null => {}
    }
    v[0] = 99;
    var sum = 0;
    for (x in v) {
        sum += x;
    }
    Console.writeLine(sum);
}
```

```

A vector can be passed where a `Slice<T>` is expected (it lends its elements), and `mut v` where a `SliceMut<T>` is.
`v.view()` and `v.viewMut()` give the slices explicitly. Other members: `capacity`, `clear()`, `truncate(n)`,
`swap(i, j)`, and `Vector<T>.withCapacity(n)`.

**Invalidation is a compile error.** Growing a vector may move its elements, so while any element or view of it is
borrowed, `push`, `pop`, `clear` and writes are rejected. This is the most common thing the borrow checker catches
in code that would crash in C++.

## Text: `StringView` and `String`

`StringView` is a read-only view of UTF-8 text: string literals are views, and so are slices of strings. `String`
owns growable text.

```ceesafe
fn greet(name: StringView) -> Result<String, AllocError> {
    var s = String.withCapacity(name.length + 7)?;
    s.append("Hello, ")?;
    s.append(name)?;
    s.append("! You are visitor ")?;
    s.appendNumber(42)?;
    return Ok(s);
}

fn main() {
    let message = greet("Ada")!;
    Console.writeLine(message);
    let word: StringView = "CeeSafe language";
    Console.writeLine(word[0..7]);
    Console.writeLine(word.length);
    Console.writeLine(word == "CeeSafe language");
}
```

```text
Hello, Ada! You are visitor 42
CeeSafe
16
true
```

- `length` is in bytes; `s[i]` is a byte (`u8`); `s.bytes()` is a `Slice<u8>`.
- Slicing (`s[lo..hi]`) checks that both ends fall on character boundaries.
- A `String` can only receive valid UTF-8 (`append` takes a view, which always is), so its contents are always valid
  text.
- `==` compares bytes.

## Stable references: `SlotMap` and `StableVector`

Sometimes values must refer to each other, as in a graph. A reference stored in a value would borrow the collection
for as long as the value lives. A `SlotMap` gives out **handles** instead: plain values that name an element, can be
stored anywhere, and are checked on every use, so a handle to a removed element finds nothing instead of something
else.

```ceesafe
struct Node {
    value: i32;
    next: Handle<Node>?;
}

fn main() {
    var nodes = SlotMap<Node>.create();
    let a = nodes.insert(Node { value: 1, next: null })!;
    let b = nodes.insert(Node { value: 2, next: a })!;
    match (nodes.get(b)) {
        Some(node) => { Console.writeLine(node.value); }
        null => {}
    }
    let removed = nodes.remove(a);
    Console.writeLine(nodes.get(a) == null);             // the handle is stale now
    Console.writeLine(nodes.length);
}
```

```text

true
1
```

`StableVector<T>` is a grow-only sequence whose elements never move, so an element can stay borrowed while more are
pushed.
