# What CeeSafe is

CeeSafe is a memory-safe systems programming language. Its syntax will look familiar if you know C# or TypeScript; its
safety comes from ownership and borrowing, as in Rust. It is compiled ahead of time to portable C11, so it runs
wherever a C compiler does: on Linux, macOS and Windows, on bare metal, and inside an operating system kernel.

```ceesafe
struct Account {
    id: u64;
    balance: i64;

    public fn deposit(borrow mut this, amount: i64) {
        this.balance += amount;
    }

    drop {
        Console.write("closing account ");
        Console.writeLine(this.id);
    }
}

fn main() {
    var account = Account { id: 7, balance: 0 };
    account.deposit(100);
    Console.writeLine(account.balance);
}
```

```text
100
closing account 7
```

## What it promises

In safe code, which is all code outside an `unsafe` block, CeeSafe rules out:

- **use after free and double free:** every value has one owner, and it is destroyed exactly once;
- **dangling references:** a reference cannot outlive what it refers to, which the compiler checks without lifetime
  annotations in most code;
- **data races between a reference and a write:** while something is borrowed it cannot be changed, and while it is
  borrowed mutably nothing else can read it;
- **out-of-bounds access and reading uninitialised memory:** indexes are checked, and a variable must be assigned
  before it is read;
- **silent integer overflow:** arithmetic that overflows stops the program, in every build. Where wrapping is meant,
  the code says so (`x.wrappingAdd(y)`).

It does this **without a garbage collector or reference counting.** Destruction is deterministic: a value is destroyed
at the end of its scope, or when its owner is, in an order the language defines.

## What makes it different

- **Lifetimes without annotations, mostly.** A function that takes and returns references names the parameters its
  result borrows from (`-> borrow(a, b) T`). Only types that store references, and functions over them, declare
  region parameters.
- **Allocation is explicit and pluggable.** Each allocation chooses its allocator: the system heap, an arena, a pool,
  a fixed buffer, a scratch frame, or your own. Allocation failure is a value (`Result<T, AllocError>`), handled or
  propagated with `?`.
- **The compiler shows its work.** It can explain which boxes it placed on the stack and which bounds and overflow
  checks it removed, and why.
- **C you can read.** The generated C is structured and warning-free, maps back to CeeSafe lines for debuggers, and has
  no undefined behaviour by design. A reference interpreter runs the same programs and stops on any memory error,
  which makes it a second implementation to test the compiler against.
- **Built for kernels too.** A freestanding profile without a C library, context effects that reject sleeping while a
  spin lock is held, C structs imported from the C codebase's own headers, and lock guards and reference-counted
  kernel objects. All of this was exercised, as Nova, inside [CosmoOS](https://github.com/vkuttyp/CosmoOS), an
  operating system written in C.

## Status

CeeSafe is **pre-1.0**. It forked from Nova 0.6.0, an equal language at the fork, and its compiler, `ceesafec`, is
written in CeeSafe and compiles itself. The language and its tools work end to end, and are tested against Nova's
corpus of about 550 programs and against novac 0.6.0's output. But nobody has used it in production. What is done and
what is next are in the repository's `ROADMAP.md`.

Some things it does not have yet: trigonometry and logarithms, iterators
beyond `for` over arrays, slices and vectors. Each is
planned, or recorded as an open decision in [Nova's list at the fork](https://github.com/vkuttyp/Nova/blob/v0.6.0/docs/open-decisions.md).

## Where to go next

- [Install the compiler](installation.md) and [write a first program](getting-started.md).
- Read [the language guide](basics.md), chapter by chapter.
- Coming from another language? Start with [CeeSafe for Rust, Zig, C, C# and Go programmers](coming-from/index.md).
- The full rules are in the [specification](../spec/README.md): the grammar, the type system and the ownership rules.
